# CappaWork Launch Checklist

## üöÄ Final Launch Steps

### Content Updates (Complete Before Deployment)
- [ ] **Update Calendly link** - Replace with correct booking URL
- [ ] **Update work portfolio screenshots** - Replace placeholder images with actual live screenshots
- [ ] **Update work portfolio link** - Change to live version URL
- [ ] **Final content review** - Proofread all copy and links

### Deployment to Vercel
- [ ] Connect GitHub repository to Vercel
- [ ] Deploy initial version
- [ ] Test all functionality on Vercel staging URL
- [ ] Add `cappawork.com` as custom domain in Vercel dashboard

- [ ] Verify portfolio links and screenshots display correctly

## üåê Domain Transfer Process

### DNS Backup (CRITICAL - Do First)

- [ ] Document current A record: `23.227.38.73` (Shopify IP)
- [ ] Document current www CNAME: `shops.myshopify.com`
- [ ] Note any MX records for email (keep these)

### Launch Day DNS Switch
**When ready to go live:**
- [ ] Log into Shopify Admin ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Domains ‚Üí cappawork.com ‚Üí Advanced settings
- [ ] **Update A record:** Change `@` from `23.227.38.73` to Vercel's provided IP
- [ ] **Update www CNAME:** Change from `shops.myshopify.com` to your Vercel app URL
- [ ] **Keep existing MX records** (if you have email setup)
- [ ] **Remove unnecessary CNAMEs** (Shopify-specific domain keys can be deleted)

### Post-Launch Verification
- [ ] Wait 2-24 hours for DNS propagation
- [ ] Test `cappawork.com` loads new site
- [ ] Test `www.cappawork.com` also works
- [ ] Use DNS checker (whatsmydns.net) to verify global propagation
- [ ] Test contact form on live domain
- [ ] Monitor for any issues first 48 hours

### Complete Domain Transfer to Namecheap
**After site is stable (can be done later):**
- [ ] Contact Shopify support to unlock domain
- [ ] Request EPP/authorization code from Shopify
- [ ] Log into Namecheap account (where workportfolio.io is hosted)
- [ ] Initiate domain transfer with EPP code
- [ ] Pay transfer fee (includes 1-year renewal)
- [ ] Wait 5-7 days for transfer completion
- [ ] Update DNS at Namecheap to point to Vercel (same settings as Shopify)
